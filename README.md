# UDC Google Maps

This is the fifth project for Udacity's full stack web developer nanodegree program.  This project uses Google Maps API to display markers that can be clicked on, which displays information about the marked area.  The address in each infowindow is provided by Foursquare's API.  



## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need a modern web browser.  I personally used version 67.0.3396.99 (64-bit) Google Chrome Browser.

### Installing

Once you have downloaded the file, just open the downloaded directory, and open the main.html file, either manually or through typing the command
```
open main.html
```
into your terminal once you are in the downloaded directory.



## Built With
HTML5, CSS, Javascript.  As well as the following APIs and Frameworks:

* [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) - Third Party API to gather address information from.
* [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) - Google Maps API
